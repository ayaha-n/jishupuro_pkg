# jishupuro_pkg

## How to use
To activate devices, do:
```
roscd jishupuro_pkg
cd scripts
./setup.sh
```
You can test if devices are activated by doing this:
```
rostopic pub -1 /eye_status std_msgs/UInt16 "data: 6"
```

Since Hume API can only be used in Python3.8, if your radxa's python version is different, you should do this:
```
cd ~/test_app
python3.8 -m venv test_app_venv
source test_app_venv/bin/activate
```
and do:
```
rosrun jishupuro_pkg topic_subscriber.py
```
To see the initial setup for python3.8 virtual environment, visit
https://www.linuxcapable.com/how-to-install-python-3-8-on-debian-linux/#google_vignette .

To launch a webpage, do these:
```
roslaunch roswww roswww.launch 
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
```
Now, visit http://<radxa's ip>:8085/jishupuro_pkg/hume_control_getip.html and fill in the blank with your radxa's IP adress, press "Set IP Address" button.

You can start the program by pressing "Start Hume", and stop it by "Stop Hume".
